# Knife Shot

This project I used all my knowledge at that time to create this game. The whole objective is to shot a knife through moving objects without hitting them. You can see the gif for game play. 

## What I learned:

	-[x] Working with Lists of gameobjects
	-[x] Animation without using spritesheets
	-[x] Worked with Unity ads to give the player a second chance once they watch an ad.
